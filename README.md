# Retro-Shooter-Game
This is the repo of the game file and source code of a 2D, top-down, twin-stick shooter developed in a proprietary C++ engine that uses DX12. This was made as a school project at UNT in the Fall of 2022 by myself and 2 other group members.

Run the game by simply double clicking the Game.exe! 

Controls:
WASD-Move
Arrows-Turn
Space-Shoot
R-Reload
1234-Switch Weapons
F/T-Slow Time!

WARNING! The sound effects might be quite loud! Sorry!
